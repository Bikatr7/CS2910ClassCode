I chose Svelte because I have heard of it before and wanted to try it out.

I'm already familiar with React and Vue, Angular is agony, and Ember sounded boring.

So -

Likes -

Built in reactivity.

I enjoyed learning it, having the accessability built in is a huge plus, and while it was annoying sometimes I feel like it's incredibly helpful to have something like that built in.

I also like the fact that is compiled, no bullshit or build step.

Dislikes -

I don't like the syntax, it feels like a mix between JS and HTML. I know it's less boilerplate, but I actuall prefer jsx/tsx

$: is especially annoying.

That's it though. Seems nice otherwise.
